# Common installation problems

Below you can find the most common issues users encounter when installing omnibus-gitlab packages.

### Hash Sum mismatch when downloading packages

apt-get install outputs something like:

```
E: Failed to fetch https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ce/ubuntu/pool/trusty/main/g/gitlab-ce/gitlab-ce_8.1.0-ce.0_amd64.deb  Hash Sum mismatch
```

Please run the following to fix this:

```
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/*
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get clean
```

See [Joe Damato's from Packagecloud comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/628#note_1824330) for more context.

Another workaround is to download the package manually by selecting the correct package from [packages.gitlab.com CE](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ce) [or EE repository](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ee):

```
curl -LJO https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ce/packages/ubuntu/trusty/gitlab-ce_8.1.0-ce.0_amd64.deb/download
dpkg -i gitlab-ce_8.1.0-ce.0_amd64.deb
```

### GitLab is unreachable in my browser

Try [specifying](#configuring-the-external-url-for-gitlab) an `external_url` in
`/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`. Also check your firewall settings; port 80 (HTTP) or
443 (HTTPS) might be closed on your GitLab server.

### GitLab CI shows GitLab login page

This section is deprecated for GitLab 8.0 and later versions.

### Emails are not being delivered

To test email delivery you can create a new GitLab account for an email that is
not used in your GitLab instance yet.

If necessary, you can modify the 'From' field of the emails sent by GitLab with
the following setting in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

```
gitlab_rails['gitlab_email_from'] = 'gitlab@example.com'
```

Run `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` for the change to take effect.

### Reconfigure freezes at `ruby_block[supervise_redis_sleep] action run`

*Note* This should be resolved starting from 7.13 omnibus-gitlab packages.

During the first `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` run, omnibus-gitlab needs to figure
out if your Linux server is using SysV Init, Upstart or Systemd so that it can
install and activate the `gitlab-runsvdir` service. If `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`
makes the wrong decision, it will later hang at
`ruby_block[supervise_redis_sleep] action run`.

The choice of init system is currently made in [the embedded Runit
cookbook](files/gitlab-cookbooks/runit/recipes/default.rb) by essentially
looking at the output of `uname -a`, `/etc/issue` and others. This mechanism
can make the wrong decision in situations such as:

- your OS release looks like 'Debian 7' but it is really some variant which
  uses Upstart instead of SysV Init;
- your OS release is unknown to the Runit cookbook (e.g. ClearOS 6.5).

Solving problems like this would require changes to the embedded Runit
cookbook; Merge Requests are welcome. Until this problem is fixed, you can work
around it by manually performing the appropriate installation steps for your
particular init system. For instance, to manually set up `gitlab-runsvdir` with
Upstart, you can do the following:

```
sudo cp /opt/gitlab/embedded/cookbooks/runit/files/default/gitlab-runsvdir.conf /etc/init/
sudo initctl start gitlab-runsvdir
sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure # Resume gitlab-ctl reconfigure
```

### TCP ports for GitLab services are already taken

By default, Unicorn listens at TCP address 127.0.0.1:8080. Nginx
listens on port 80 (HTTP) and/or 443 (HTTPS) on all interfaces.

The ports for Redis, PostgreSQL and Unicorn can be overriden in
`/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` as follows:

```ruby
redis['port'] = 1234
postgresql['port'] = 2345
unicorn['port'] = 3456
```

For Nginx port changes please see
[doc/settings/nginx.md](doc/settings/nginx.md).

### Git SSH access stops working on SELinux-enabled systems

On SELinux-enabled systems the git user's `.ssh` directory or its contents can
get their security context messed up. You can fix this by running `sudo
gitlab-ctl reconfigure`, which will run a `chcon --recursive` command on
`/var/opt/gitlab/.ssh`.

### Postgres error 'FATAL:  could not create shared memory segment: Cannot allocate memory'

The packaged Postgres instance will try to allocate 25% of total memory as
shared memory. On some Linux (virtual) servers, there is less shared memory
available, which will prevent Postgres from starting. In
`/var/log/gitlab/postgresql/current`:

```
  1885  2014-08-08_16:28:43.71000 FATAL:  could not create shared memory segment: Cannot allocate memory
  1886  2014-08-08_16:28:43.71002 DETAIL:  Failed system call was shmget(key=5432001, size=1126563840, 03600).
  1887  2014-08-08_16:28:43.71003 HINT:  This error usually means that PostgreSQL's request for a shared memory segment exceeded available memory or swap space, or exceeded your kernel's SHMALL parameter.  You can either reduce the request size or reconfigure the kernel with larger SHMALL.  To reduce the request size (currently 1126563840 bytes), reduce PostgreSQL's shared memory usage, perhaps by reducing shared_buffers or max_connections.
  1888  2014-08-08_16:28:43.71004       The PostgreSQL documentation contains more information about shared memory configuration.
```

You can manually lower the amount of shared memory Postgres tries to allocate
in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

```ruby
postgresql['shared_buffers'] = "100MB"
```

Run `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` for the change to take effect.

### Reconfigure complains about the GLIBC version

```
$ gitlab-ctl reconfigure
/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/ruby: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by /opt/gitlab/embedded/lib/libruby.so.2.1)
/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/ruby: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.17' not found (required by /opt/gitlab/embedded/lib/libruby.so.2.1)
```

This can happen if the omnibus package you installed was built for a different
OS release than the one on your server. Double-check that you downloaded and
installed the correct omnibus-gitlab package for your operating system.

### Reconfigure fails to create the git user

This can happen if you run `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` as the git user.
Switch to another user.

More importantly: do not give sudo rights to the git user or to any of the
other users used by omnibus-gitlab. Bestowing unnecessary privileges on a
system user weakens the security of your system.

### Failed to modify kernel parameters with sysctl

If sysctl cannot modify the kernel parameters you could possibly get an error with the following stack trace:

```
 * execute[sysctl] action run
================================================================================
Error executing action `run` on resource 'execute[sysctl]'
================================================================================


Mixlib::ShellOut::ShellCommandFailed
------------------------------------
Expected process to exit with [0], but received '255'
---- Begin output of /sbin/sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf ----

```
This is unlikely to happen with non virtualized machines but on a VPS with virtualization like openVZ, container might not have the required module enabled
or container doesn't have access to kernel parameters.

Try enabling the module on which sysctl errored out, on how to enable the module see example [here](http://serverfault.com/questions/477718/sysctl-p-etc-sysctl-conf-returns-error).

There is a reported workaround described in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/361) which requires editing the GitLab' internal recipe by supplying the switch which will ignore failures. Ignoring errors can have unexpected side effects on performance of your GitLab server so it is not recommended to do so.

### I am unable to install omnibus-gitlab without root access

Occasionally people ask if they can install GitLab without root access. This is
not possible because GitLab uses multiple system users (privilege separation)
for security reasons. The `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` script needs root access to
create/manage these users and the files they have access to.

Once GitLab is up an running on your system, you will see that several
processes run as root, for instance the 'runsv' and 'runsvdir' processes
(Runit) and the NGINX master process. Runit is a process supervisor that
manages the different GitLab services for you. Because those services run as
different users (privilege separation), and Runit needs to manage all of those
services, Runit itself needs root. NGINX (the front-end web server) has its own
built-in process supervision and privilege separation. It has a 'master'
process running as root that can open privileged TCP ports (80/443) and files
(SSL certificates), while pushing the risky business of handling web requests
to 'worker' processes running as gitlab-www.

### gitlab-rake assets:precompile fails with 'Permission denied'

Some users report that running `gitlab-rake assets:precompile` does not work
with the omnibus packages. The short answer to this is: do not run that
command, it is only for GitLab installations from source.

The GitLab web interface uses CSS and JavaScript files, called 'assets' in Ruby
on Rails-speak. In the [upstream GitLab
repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/tree/master/app/assets)
these files are stored in a developer-friendly way: easy to read and edit. When
you are a normal user of GitLab, you do not want these files to be in the
developer friendly format however because that makes GitLab slow. This is why
part of the GitLab setup process is to convert the assets from a
developer-friendly format to an end-user friendly (compact, fast) format; that
is what the `rake assets:precompile` script is for.

When you install GitLab from source (which was the only way to do it before we
had omnibus packages) you need to convert the assets on your GitLab server
every time you update GitLab. People used to overlook this step and there are
still posts, comments and mails out there on the internet where users recommend
each other to run `rake assets:precompile`. With the omnibus packages things
are different: when we build the package [we convert the assets for
you](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/1cfe925e0c015df7722bb85eddc0b4a3b59c1211/config/software/gitlab-rails.rb#L74).
When you install GitLab with an omnibus package, the converted assets are
already there! That is why you do not need to run `rake assets:precompile` when
you install GitLab from a package.

When `gitlab-rake assets:precompile` fails with a permission error it fails for
a good reason from a security standpoint: the fact that the assets cannot
easily be rewritten makes it harder for an attacker to use your GitLab server
to serve evil JavaScript code to the visitors of your GitLab server.

If you want to run GitLab with custom JavaScript or CSS code you are probably
better off running GitLab from source, or building your own packages.

### 'Short read or OOM loading DB' error

Try cleaning the old redis session by following the [documentation here.](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/operations/cleaning_up_redis_sessions.html)

### Apt error 'The requested URL returned error: 403'

When trying to install GitLab using the apt repo if you receive an error similar to:

```bash
W: Failed to fetch https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ce/DISTRO/dists/CODENAME/main/source/Sources  The requested URL returned error: 403
```

check if there is a repository cacher in front of your server, like for example `apt-cacher-ng`.

Add the following line to apt-cacher-ng config(eg. in  `/etc/apt-cacher-ng/acng.conf`):

```bash
PassThroughPattern: (packages\.gitlab\.com|packages-gitlab-com\.s3\.amazonaws\.com)
```

Read more about `apt-cacher-ng` and the reasons why this change is needed [on the packagecloud blog](http://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2015/05/05/using-apt-cacher-ng-with-ssl-tls/).

### Error executing action create on resource cron[gitlab-ci schedule builds]

1. Double check if you have cron package installed: For Debian like systems `sudo apt-get install cron` or RHEL-like systems `sudo yum install cronie`
1. Check if user `gitlab-ci` is in `/etc/cron.deny` and if yes remove it. You can add the `gitlab-ci` user to `/etc/cron.allow``.
1. Check if you have PAM enabled and if gitlab-ci user is allowed to access crontab. If yes, try changing your `/etc/security/access.conf` to allow the user access to the resource, for example `+:gitlab-ci:ALL`.
