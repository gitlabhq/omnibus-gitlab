# GitLab CI

You can run a [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/) Coordinator
service on your GitLab server.

## Documentation version

Make sure you view this guide from the tag (version) of GitLab you would like
to install. In most cases this should be the highest numbered production tag
(without rc in it). You can select the tag in the version dropdown in the top
left corner of GitLab (below the menu bar).

If the highest number stable branch is unclear please check the
[GitLab Blog](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/) for installation guide links by
version.

Starting with GitLab 8.0, GitLab CI is integrated into GitLab.
