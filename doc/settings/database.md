{{< /details >}}

GitLab supports only the PostgreSQL database management system.

Thus you have two options for database servers to use with a Linux package installation:

- Use the packaged PostgreSQL server included with the Linux package installation (no
  configuration required, recommended).
- Use an [external PostgreSQL server](#using-a-non-packaged-postgresql-database-management-server).

## Using the PostgreSQL database service shipped with the Linux package

### Reconfigure and PostgreSQL restarts

Linux package installations usually restart any service on reconfigure if configuration settings for that service were
changed in the `gitlab.rb` file. PostgreSQL is unique in that some of its settings take effect
with a reload (HUP), while others require PostgreSQL to be restarted. Because administrators
frequently want more control over exactly when PostgreSQL is restarted, Linux package installations are configured
to do a reload of PostgreSQL on reconfigure, and not a restart. This means that if you modify any
PostgreSQL setting that requires a restart, you will need to restart PostgreSQL manually after you
reconfigure.

The [GitLab config template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/files/gitlab-config-template/gitlab.rb.template)
identifies which PostgreSQL settings require a restart and which require only a reload. You can also
run a query against your database to determine if any individual setting requires a restart. Start a
database console with `sudo gitlab-psql`, then replace `<setting name>` in the following query
with the setting you are changing:

```sql
SELECT name,setting FROM pg_settings WHERE context = 'postmaster' AND name = '<setting name>';
```

If changing the setting will require a restart, the query will return the name of the setting and the current value
of that setting in the running PostgreSQL instance.

#### Automatic restart when the PostgreSQL version changes

By default, Linux package installations automatically restart PostgreSQL when the underlying
version changes, as suggested by the [upstream documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/upgrading.html).
This behavior can be controlled using the `auto_restart_on_version_change` setting
available for `postgresql` and `geo-postgresql`.

To disable automatic restarts when the PostgreSQL version changes:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and add the following line:

   ```ruby
   # For PostgreSQL/Patroni
   postgresql['auto_restart_on_version_change'] = false

   # For Geo PostgreSQL
   geo_postgresql['auto_restart_on_version_change'] = false
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

{{< alert type="note" >}}

It is highly recommended to restart PostgreSQL when the underlying version changes,
to avoid errors like the [one related to loading necessary libraries](#could-not-load-library-plpgsqlso).

### Configuring SSL

Linux package installations automatically enable SSL on the PostgreSQL server, but it will accept
both encrypted and unencrypted connections by default. Enforcing SSL requires
using the `hostssl` configuration in `pg_hba.conf`. For more details, see the
[`pg_hba.conf` documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

SSL support depends on the following files:

- The public SSL certificate for the database (`server.crt`).
- The corresponding private key for the SSL certificate (`server.key`).
- A root certificate bundle that validates the server's certificate (`root.crt`).
  By default, Linux package installations use the embedded certificate bundle in
  `/opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs/cacert.pem`. This isn't required for
  self-signed certificates.

A 10-year self-signed certificate and private key are generated by a Linux package installation for use. If you'd
prefer to use a CA-signed certificate or replace this with your own self-signed certificate, use the following steps.

The location of these files can be configurable, but the private key
must be readable by the `gitlab-psql` user. Linux package installations manage the permissions of
the files for you, but if the paths are customized, you must ensure that the
`gitlab-psql` can access the directory in the files are placed in.

For more details, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/ssl-tcp.html).

Note that `server.crt` and `server.key` may be different from the default SSL
certificates used to access GitLab. For example, suppose the external hostname
of your database is `database.example.com`, and your external GitLab hostname
is `gitlab.example.com`. You will either need a wildcard certificate for
`*.example.com` or two different SSL certificates.

The `ssl_cert_file`, `ssl_key_file`, and `ssl_ca_file` files direct PostgreSQL to where
on the filesystem to find the certificate, key, and bundle. These changes are applied to
`postgresql.conf`. The directives `internal_certificate` and `internal_key` are used to
populate the contents of these files. The contents can be added directly or
loaded from file as shown in the following example.

After you have these files, enable SSL:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   postgresql['ssl_cert_file'] = '/custom/path/to/server.crt'
   postgresql['ssl_key_file'] = '/custom/path/to/server.key'
   postgresql['ssl_ca_file'] = '/custom/path/to/bundle.pem'
   postgresql['internal_certificate'] = File.read('/custom/path/to/server.crt')
   postgresql['internal_key'] = File.read('/custom/path/to/server.key')
   ```

   Relative paths will be rooted in the PostgreSQL data directory
   (`/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data` by default).

1. [Reconfigure GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/restart_gitlab/#reconfigure-a-linux-package-installation) to apply the configuration changes.

1. Restart PostgreSQL for the changes to take effect:

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl restart postgresql
   ```

   If PostgreSQL fails to start, check the logs (for example,
   `/var/log/gitlab/postgresql/current`) for more details.

#### Require SSL

1. Add the following to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['db_sslmode'] = 'require'
   ```

1. [Reconfigure GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/restart_gitlab/#reconfigure-a-linux-package-installation) to apply the configuration changes.

#### Disabling SSL

1. Add the following to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   postgresql['ssl'] = 'off'
   ```

1. [Reconfigure GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/restart_gitlab/#reconfigure-a-linux-package-installation) to apply the configuration changes.

1. Restart PostgreSQL for the changes to take effect:

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl restart postgresql
   ```

   If PostgreSQL fails to start, check the logs (for example,
   `/var/log/gitlab/postgresql/current`) for more details.

#### Verifying that SSL is being used

To determine whether SSL is being used by clients, you can run:

```shell
sudo gitlab-rails dbconsole --database main
```

At startup, you should see a banner as the following:

```plaintext
psql (13.14)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: on)
Type "help" for help.
```

To determine if clients are using SSL, issue this SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_ssl;
```

For example:

```plaintext
gitlabhq_production=> select * from pg_stat_ssl;
 pid  | ssl | version |         cipher         | bits | compression |  clientdn
------+-----+---------+------------------------+------+-------------+------------
  384 | f   |         |                        |      |             |
  386 | f   |         |                        |      |             |
  998 | t   | TLSv1.3 | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 |  256 | f           | /CN=gitlab
  933 | f   |         |                        |      |             |
 1003 | t   | TLSv1.3 | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 |  256 | f           | /CN=gitlab
 1016 | t   | TLSv1.3 | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 |  256 | f           | /CN=gitlab
 1022 | t   | TLSv1.3 | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 |  256 | f           | /CN=gitlab
 1211 | t   | TLSv1.3 | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 |  256 | f           | /CN=gitlab
 1214 | t   | TLSv1.3 | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 |  256 | f           | /CN=gitlab
 1213 | t   | TLSv1.3 | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 |  256 | f           | /CN=gitlab
 1215 | t   | TLSv1.3 | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 |  256 | f           | /CN=gitlab
 1252 | t   | TLSv1.3 | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 |  256 | f           |
 1280 | t   | TLSv1.3 | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 |  256 | f           | /CN=gitlab
  382 | f   |         |                        |      |             |
  381 | f   |         |                        |      |             |
  383 | f   |         |                        |      |             |
(16 rows)
```

1. Rows that have `t` listed under the `ssl` column are enabled.
1. Rows that have a value in the `clientdn` are using the `cert` authentication method

#### Configure SSL client authentication

Client SSL certificates can be used to authenticate to the database server. Creating the certificates
is beyond the scope of `omnibus-gitlab`. But users who have an existing SSL certificate management solution
can use this.

##### Configure the database server

1. Create a certificate and key for the server, the common name should equal the DNS name of the server
1. Copy the server certificate, key, and CA file to the PostgreSQL server, and ensure the permissions are correct
   1. The certificate should be owned by the database user (default: `gitlab-psql`)
   1. The key file should be owned by the database user, and its permissions should be `0400`
   1. The CA file should be owned by the database user, and its permissions should be `0400`

   {{< alert type="note" >}}

   Don't use the file names `server.crt` or `server.key` for these files. These
   file names are reserved for the internal use of `omnibus-gitlab`.

   {{< /alert >}}

1. Ensure the following is set in `gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   postgresql['ssl_cert_file'] = 'PATH_TO_CERTIFICATE'
   postgresql['ssl_key_file'] = 'PATH_TO_KEY_FILE'
   postgresql['ssl_ca_file'] = 'PATH_TO_CA_FILE'
   postgresql['listen_address'] = 'IP_ADDRESS'
   postgresql['cert_auth_addresses'] = {
   'IP_ADDRESS' => {
     'database' => 'gitlabhq_production',
     'user' => 'gitlab'
   }
   ```

   Set `listen_address` as the IP address of the server that the clients will use
   to connect to the database.
   Ensure `cert_auth_addresses` contains a list of IP addresses and the
   databases and users that are allowed to connect to the database. You can use
   CIDR notation when specifying the key for `cert_auth_addresses` to
   incorporate an IP address range.

1. Run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`, and then `gitlab-ctl restart postgresql` for
   the new settings to take effect.

#### Configure the Rails client

For the rails client to connect to the server, you will need a certificate and key with the `commonName` set to `gitlab`, which is signed by a certificate authority trusted in the CA file specified in `ssl_ca_file` on the database server.

1. Configure `gitlab.rb`

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['db_host'] = 'IP_ADDRESS_OR_HOSTNAME_OF_DATABASE_SERVER'
   gitlab_rails['db_sslcert'] = 'PATH_TO_CERTIFICATE_FILE'
   gitlab_rails['db_sslkey'] = 'PATH_TO_KEY_FILE'
   gitlab_rails['db_rootcert'] = 'PATH_TO_CA_FILE'
   ```

1. Run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` for the rails client to use the new settings
1. Follow the steps in [Verifying that SSL is being used](#verifying-that-ssl-is-being-used) to ensure the authentication is working.

### Configure packaged PostgreSQL server to listen on TCP/IP

The packaged PostgreSQL server can be configured to listen for TCP/IP connections,
with the caveat that some non-critical scripts expect UNIX sockets and may misbehave.

To configure the use of TCP/IP for the database service, make changes to both
the `postgresql` and `gitlab_rails` sections of `gitlab.rb`.

#### Configure PostgreSQL block

The following settings are affected in the `postgresql` block:

- `listen_address`: Controls the address on which PostgreSQL will listen.
- `port`: Controls the port on which PostgreSQL listens to. The default is `5432`.
- `md5_auth_cidr_addresses`: A list of CIDR address blocks that are allowed to
  connect to the server, after authentication with a password.
- `trust_auth_cidr_addresses`: A list of CIDR address blocks that are allowed
  to connect to the server, without authentication of any kind. You should
  only set this setting to allow connections from nodes that need to connect,
  such as GitLab Rails or Sidekiq. This includes local connections when deployed
  on the same node or from components such as Postgres Exporter (`127.0.0.1/32`).
- `sql_user`: Controls the expected username for MD5 authentication. This
  defaults to `gitlab`, and isn't a required setting.
- `sql_user_password`: Sets the password that PostgreSQL will accept for MD5
  authentication.

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   postgresql['listen_address'] = '0.0.0.0'
   postgresql['port'] = 5432
   postgresql['md5_auth_cidr_addresses'] = %w()
   postgresql['trust_auth_cidr_addresses'] = %w(127.0.0.1/24)
   postgresql['sql_user'] = "gitlab"

   ##! SQL_USER_PASSWORD_HASH can be generated using the command `gitlab-ctl pg-password-md5 'gitlab'`,
   ##! where 'gitlab' (single-quoted to avoid shell interpolation) is the name of the SQL user that connects to GitLab.
   ##! You will be prompted for a password which other clients will use to authenticate with database, such as `securesqlpassword` in the below section.
   postgresql['sql_user_password'] = "SQL_USER_PASSWORD_HASH"

   # force ssl on all connections defined in trust_auth_cidr_addresses and md5_auth_cidr_addresses
   postgresql['hostssl'] = true
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab and restart PostrgreSQL:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   sudo gitlab-ctl restart postgresql
   ```

Any client or GitLab service which will connect over the network will need to
provide the values of `sql_user` for the username, and password provided to the
configuration when connecting to the PostgreSQL server. They must also be in the
network block provided to `md5_auth_cidr_addresses`

#### Configure GitLab Rails block

To configure the `gitlab-rails` application to connect to the PostgreSQL database
over the network, several settings must be configured:

- `db_host`: Needs to be set to the IP address of the database server. If this is
  on the same instance as the PostgreSQL service, this can be `127.0.0.1` and does
  not require password authentication.
- `db_port`: Sets the port on the PostgreSQL server to connect to, and must be set
  if `db_host` is set.
- `db_username`: Configures the username with which to connect to PostgreSQL. This
  defaults to `gitlab`.
- `db_password`: Must be provided if connecting to PostgreSQL over TCP/IP, and from
  an instance in the `postgresql['md5_auth_cidr_addresses']` block from settings
  above. This is not required if you are connecting to `127.0.0.1` and have configured
  `postgresql['trust_auth_cidr_addresses']` to include it.

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['db_host'] = '127.0.0.1'
   gitlab_rails['db_port'] = 5432
   gitlab_rails['db_username'] = "gitlab"
   gitlab_rails['db_password'] = "securesqlpassword"
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab and restart PostrgreSQL:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   sudo gitlab-ctl restart postgresql
   ```

#### Apply and restart services

After making the previous changes, an administrator should run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.
If you experience any issues in regards to the service not listening on TCP, try
directly restarting the service with `gitlab-ctl restart postgresql`.

Some included scripts of the Linux package (such as `gitlab-psql`) expect the
connections to PostgreSQL to be handled over the UNIX socket, and may not function
properly. You can enable TCP/IP without disabling UNIX sockets.

To test access from other clients, you can run:

```shell
sudo gitlab-rails dbconsole --database main
```

### Enabling PostgreSQL WAL (Write Ahead Log) Archiving

By default, WAL archiving of the packaged PostgreSQL isn't enabled. Consider the
following when seeking to enable WAL archiving:

- The WAL level needs to be 'replica' or higher (9.6+ options are `minimal`,
  `replica`, or `logical`)
- Increasing the WAL level will increase the amount of storage consumed in
  regular operations

To enable WAL Archiving:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   # Replication settings
   postgresql['sql_replication_user'] = "gitlab_replicator"
   postgresql['wal_level'] = "replica"
       ...
       ...
   # Backup/Archive settings
   postgresql['archive_mode'] = "on"
   postgresql['archive_command'] = "/your/wal/archiver/here"
   postgresql['archive_timeout'] = "60"
   ```

1. [Reconfigure GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/restart_gitlab/#reconfigure-a-linux-package-installation) for the changes to take effect. This will result in a database restart.

### Store PostgreSQL data in a different directory

By default, everything is stored under `/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql`, controlled
by the `postgresql['dir']` attribute.

This consists of:

- The database socket will be `/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432`. This
  is controlled by `postgresql['unix_socket_directory']`.
- The `gitlab-psql` system user will have its `HOME` directory set to this. This
  is controlled by `postgresql['home']`.
- The actual data will be stored in `/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data`.

To change the location of the PostgreSQL data

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

If you have an existing database, you need to move the data to the new location
first.

{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

This is an intrusive operation. It cannot be done without downtime on an
existing installation
{{< /alert >}}

1. If this is an existing installation, stop GitLab: `gitlab-ctl stop`.
1. Update `postgresql['dir']` to the desired location.
1. Run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.
1. Start GitLab `gitlab-ctl start`.

### Upgrade packaged PostgreSQL server

{{< alert type="note" >}}

If you have a Patroni cluster (PostgreSQL HA) managed by GitLab, use the following documentation instead:

- [Upgrading PostgreSQL major version in a Patroni cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover/#upgrading-postgresql-major-version-in-a-patroni-cluster)
- [Near-zero-downtime upgrade of PostgreSQL in a Patroni cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover/#near-zero-downtime-upgrade-of-postgresql-in-a-patroni-cluster)

{{< /alert >}}

The Linux package provides the `gitlab-ctl pg-upgrade` command to update the
packaged PostgreSQL server to a later version (if one is included in the
package). This updates PostgreSQL to the [default shipped version](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/package_information/postgresql_versions/)
during package upgrades, unless specifically [opted out](#opt-out-of-automatic-postgresql-upgrades).

Before upgrading GitLab to a newer version, refer to the [version-specific changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/#version-specific-upgrading-instructions)
of the Linux package to see either:

- When a database version has changed.
- When an upgrade is warranted.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Before upgrading, it's important that you fully read this section before running any commands. For
single-node installations, this upgrade needs downtime, as the database must be
down while the upgrade is being performed. The length of time depends on the
size of your database.

{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert type="note" >}}

If you encounter any problems during the upgrade, raise an issue with a full
description at the [`omnibus-gitlab` issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab).

{{< /alert >}}

To upgrade the PostgreSQL version, be sure that:

- You're running the latest version of GitLab that supports your current version of PostgreSQL.
- If you recently upgraded, you ran `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` successfully
  before you proceed.
- You have sufficient disk space for two copies of your database. _Do not attempt
  to upgrade unless you have enough free space available._

  - Check your database size using `sudo du -sh /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data`
    (or update your database path).
  - Check the space available using `sudo df -h`. If the partition where the
    database resides doesn't have enough space, pass the argument `--tmp-dir $DIR`
    to the command. The upgrade task includes an available disk space check and aborts
    the upgrade if the requirements aren't met.

After you confirm that the above checklist is satisfied, you can proceed with
the upgrade:

```shell
sudo gitlab-ctl pg-upgrade
```

To upgrade to a specific PostgreSQL version, use the `-V` flag to append the
version. For example, to upgrade to PostgreSQL 16:

```shell
sudo gitlab-ctl pg-upgrade -V 16
```

{{< alert type="note" >}}

`pg-upgrade` can take arguments; for example, you can set the timeout for the
execution of the underlying commands (`--timeout=1d2h3m4s5ms`). Run `gitlab-ctl pg-upgrade -h`
to see the full list.

{{< /alert >}}

`gitlab-ctl pg-upgrade` performs the following steps:

1. Checks to ensure the database is in a known good state.
1. Checks if there's enough free disk space and abort otherwise. You can skip this by appending the `--skip-disk-check` flag.
1. Shuts down the existing database and any unnecessary services, and enables GitLab to deploy page.
1. Changes the symlinks in `/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/` for PostgreSQL to point to the newer version of the database.
1. Creates a new directory containing a new, empty database with a locale matching the existing database.
1. Uses the `pg_upgrade` tool to copy the data from the old database to the new database.
1. Moves the old database out of the way.
1. Moves the new database to the expected location.
1. Calls `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` to do the required configuration changes and starts the new database server.
1. Runs `ANALYZE` to generate database statistics.
1. Starts the remaining services and removes the deploy page.
1. If any errors are detected during this process, it reverts to the old version of the database.

After the upgrade is complete, verify that everything is working as expected.

If there was an error in the output while running the `ANALYZE` step, your upgrade
will still be working but will have poor database performance until the
database statistics are generated. Use `gitlab-psql` to determine whether `ANALYZE` should be run manually:

```shell
sudo gitlab-psql -c "SELECT relname, last_analyze, last_autoanalyze FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE last_analyze IS NULL AND last_autoanalyze IS NULL;"
```

You can run `ANALYZE` manually if the query above returned any rows:

```shell
sudo gitlab-psql -c 'SET statement_timeout = 0; ANALYZE VERBOSE;'
```

The execution time of the `ANALYZE` command can vary significantly depending on your database size. To monitor the progress of this operation,
you can periodically run the following query in another console session. The `tables_remaining` column should gradually reach `0`:

```shell
sudo gitlab-psql -c "
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_tables,
    SUM(CASE WHEN last_analyze IS NULL OR last_analyze < (NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS tables_remaining
FROM pg_stat_user_tables;
"
```

After you have verified that your GitLab instance is running correctly, you
can clean up the old database files:

```shell
sudo rm -rf /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data.<old_version>
sudo rm -f /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql-version.old
```

You can find details of PostgreSQL versions shipped with various GitLab versions
in [PostgreSQL versions shipped with the Linux package](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/package_information/postgresql_versions/).

#### Opt out of automatic PostgreSQL upgrades

To opt out of automatic PostgreSQL upgrades during GitLab package upgrades, run:

```shell
sudo touch /etc/gitlab/disable-postgresql-upgrade
```

If you use the Docker image, you can disable automatic upgrades by
setting the `GITLAB_SKIP_PG_UPGRADE` environment variable to `true`.

### Revert packaged PostgreSQL server to the previous version

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

This operation reverts your current database, including its data, to its state before your last upgrade. Be sure to
create a backup before attempting to revert your packaged PostgreSQL database.

{{< /alert >}}

Earlier versions of the Linux package bundle multiple versions of PostgreSQL. If you use one of these versions, you can
use the `gitlab-ctl revert-pg-upgrade` command to revert to an earlier PostgreSQL version supported by the Linux package.
This command also supports the `-V` flag to specify a target version. For example, to revert to PostgreSQL version 14:

```shell
gitlab-ctl revert-pg-upgrade -V 14
```

If the target version is not specified, the command uses the version in `/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql-version.old`
if available. Otherwise, it falls back to the default version shipped with GitLab.

If you use a version of the Linux package that ships only one PostgreSQL version, you can't revert your PostgreSQL
version. For these versions of the Linux package, you must roll back GitLab to an earlier version to use an earlier
version of PostgreSQL.

### Configuring multiple database connections

{{< history >}}

- The `gitlab:db:decomposition:connection_status` Rake task was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/111927) in GitLab 15.11.

{{< /history >}}

In GitLab 16.0, GitLab defaults to using two database connections that point to the same PostgreSQL database.

Before upgrading to GitLab 16.0, check that the PostgreSQL `max_connections` setting is high enough so that more than 50% of available connections show as being unused.
For example, if `max_connections` is set to 100 and you see 75 connections in use, you must increase `max_connections` to at least 150 before upgrading because after
upgrading, the in-use connections will double to 150.

You can verify this by running the following Rake task:

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:db:decomposition:connection_status
```

If the task indicates that `max_connections` is high enough, then you can proceed with the upgrade.

## Using a non-packaged PostgreSQL database management server

By default, GitLab is configured to use the PostgreSQL server that's included
in the Linux package. You can also reconfigure it to use an external instance of
PostgreSQL.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

If you are using a non-packaged PostgreSQL server, you need to make
sure that PostgreSQL is set up according to the [database requirements](https://docs.gitlab.com/install/requirements/#postgresql).

{{< /alert >}}

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   # Disable the built-in Postgres
   postgresql['enable'] = false

   # Fill in the connection details for database.yml
   gitlab_rails['db_adapter'] = 'postgresql'
   gitlab_rails['db_encoding'] = 'utf8'
   gitlab_rails['db_host'] = '127.0.0.1'
   gitlab_rails['db_port'] = 5432
   gitlab_rails['db_username'] = 'USERNAME'
   gitlab_rails['db_password'] = 'PASSWORD'
   ```

   Don't forget to remove the `#` comment characters at the beginning of these
   lines.

   Note that:

   - `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` should have file permissions `0600` because it contains
     plain-text passwords.
   - PostgreSQL allows listening on [multiple addresses](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/runtime-config-connection.html)

     If you use multiple addresses in `gitlab_rails['db_host']`, comma-separated, the first address in the list will be used for the connection.

1. [Reconfigure GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/restart_gitlab/#reconfigure-a-linux-package-installation) for the changes to take effect.

1. [Seed the database](#seed-the-database-fresh-installs-only).

1. Optional. [Enable the container registry metadata database](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/packages/container_registry_metadata_database/).

### UNIX socket configuration for non-packaged PostgreSQL

If you want to use your system's PostgreSQL server (installed on the same system
as GitLab) instead of the one bundled with GitLab, you can do so by using a UNIX
socket:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   # Disable the built-in Postgres
   postgresql['enable'] = false

   # Fill in the connection details for database.yml
   gitlab_rails['db_adapter'] = 'postgresql'
   gitlab_rails['db_encoding'] = 'utf8'
   # The path where the socket lives
   gitlab_rails['db_host'] = '/var/run/postgresql/'
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab for the changes to take effect:

   ```ruby
   sudo gitlab-ctl-reconfigure
   ```

### Configuring SSL

#### Require SSL

1. Add the following to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['db_sslmode'] = 'require'
   ```

1. [Reconfigure GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/restart_gitlab/#reconfigure-a-linux-package-installation) to apply the configuration changes.

#### Require SSL and verify server certificate against CA bundle

PostgreSQL can be configured to require SSL and verify the server certificate
against a CA bundle to prevent spoofing.
The CA bundle that's specified in `gitlab_rails['db_sslrootcert']` must contain
both the root and intermediate certificates.

1. Add the following to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['db_sslmode'] = "verify-full"
   gitlab_rails['db_sslrootcert'] = "<full_path_to_your_ca-bundle.pem>"
   ```

   If you are using Amazon RDS for your PostgreSQL server, ensure you
   download and use the [combined CA bundle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem)
   for `gitlab_rails['db_sslrootcert']`. More information on this can be found
   in the [using SSL/TLS to Encrypt a Connection to a DB Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html)
   article on AWS.

1. [Reconfigure GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/restart_gitlab/#reconfigure-a-linux-package-installation) to apply the configuration changes.

### Backup and restore a non-packaged PostgreSQL database

When using the [backup](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab/#backup-command)
and [restore](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/backup_restore/restore_gitlab/#restore-for-linux-package-installations)
commands, GitLab will
attempt to use the packaged `pg_dump` command to create a database backup file
and the packaged `psql` command to restore a backup. This will only work if
they are the correct versions. Check the versions of the packaged `pg_dump` and
`psql`:

```shell
/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/pg_dump --version
/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/psql --version
```

If these versions are different from your non-packaged external PostgreSQL, you may encounter the following error output when attempting to run the [backup command](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab/#backup-command).

```plaintext
Dumping PostgreSQL database gitlabhq_production ... pg_dump: error: server version: 13.3; pg_dump version: 12.6
pg_dump: error: aborting because of server version mismatch
```

In this example, the error occurs on GitLab 14.1 when using PostgreSQL version 13.3, instead of the [default shipped PostgreSQL version](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/package_information/postgresql_versions/) of 12.6.

In this case, you will need to install tools that match your database version and then follow the
steps below. There are multiple ways to install PostgreSQL client tools. See
<https://www.postgresql.org/download/> for options.

Once the correct `psql` and `pg_dump` tools are available on your system, follow
these steps, using the correct path to the location you installed the new tools:

1. Add symbolic links to the non-packaged versions:

   ```shell
   ln -s /path/to/new/pg_dump /path/to/new/psql /opt/gitlab/bin/
   ```

1. Check the versions:

   ```shell
   /opt/gitlab/bin/pg_dump --version
   /opt/gitlab/bin/psql --version
   ```

   They should now be the same as your non-packaged external PostgreSQL.

After this is done, ensure that the backup and restore tasks are using the
correct executables by running both the [backup](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab/#backup-command) and
[restore](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/backup_restore/restore_gitlab/#restore-for-linux-package-installations) commands.

### Upgrade a non-packaged PostgreSQL database

You can upgrade the external database after stopping all the processes that are connected to the database (Puma, Sidekiq):

```shell
sudo gitlab-ctl stop puma
sudo gitlab-ctl stop sidekiq
```

Before proceeding with the upgrade, note the following:

- Check compatibility between GitLab releases and PostgreSQL versions:
  - Read about which GitLab versions introduced a requirement for a
    [minimum PostgreSQL version](https://docs.gitlab.com/install/requirements/#postgresql).
  - Read about significant changes to the PostgreSQL versions which
    [shipped with the Linux package](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/package_information/postgresql_versions/):
    The Linux package is tested for compatibility with the major releases of PostgreSQL that it ships with.
- When using GitLab backup or restore, you must keep the same version of GitLab.
  If you plan to upgrade to a later GitLab version as well, upgrade PostgreSQL first.
- The [backup and restore commands](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab/#backup-command)
  can be used to back up and restore the database to a later version of PostgreSQL.
- If a PostgreSQL version is specified with `postgresql['version']` that doesn't ship
  with that Linux package release, the
  [default version in the compatibility table](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/package_information/postgresql_versions/)
  determines which client binaries (such as the PostgreSQL backup/restore binaries) are active.

The following example demonstrates upgrading from a database host running PostgreSQL 14 to another database host running PostgreSQL 16 and incurs downtime:

1. Spin up a new PostgreSQL 16 database server that's set up according to the [database requirements](https://docs.gitlab.com/install/requirements/#postgresql).

1. Ensure that the compatible versions of `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` are being
   used on the GitLab Rails instance. To amend GitLab configuration, edit
   `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and specify the value of `postgresql['version']`:

   ```ruby
   postgresql['version'] = 16
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

1. Stop GitLab (note that this step causes downtime):

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl stop
   ```

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

The backup command requires [additional parameters](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab/#back-up-and-restore-for-installations-using-pgbouncer)
when your installation is using PgBouncer.

{{< /alert >}}

1. Run the backup Rake task using the SKIP options to back up only the database.
   Make a note of the backup filename; you'll use it later to restore.

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-backup create SKIP=repositories,uploads,builds,artifacts,lfs,pages,registry
   ```

1. Shutdown the PostgreSQL 14 database host.

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and update the `gitlab_rails['db_host']` setting
   to point to the PostgreSQL database 16 host.

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

   {{< alert type="warning" >}}

   The backup command requires [additional parameters](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab/#back-up-and-restore-for-installations-using-pgbouncer)
   when your installation is using PgBouncer.

   {{< /alert >}}

1. Restore the database using the database backup file created earlier, and be
   sure to answer **no** when asked "This task will now rebuild the `authorized_keys` file":

   ```shell
   # Use the backup timestamp https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab/#backup-timestamp
   sudo gitlab-backup restore BACKUP=<backup-timestamp>
   ```

1. Start GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl start
   ```

1. After upgrading PostgreSQL to a new major release, recreate the table statistics to ensure efficient query plans are picked and
   to reduce database server CPU load.

   If the upgrade was "in-place" using `pg_upgrade`, run the following query on the PostgreSQL database console:

   ```SQL
   SET statement_timeout = 0; ANALYZE VERBOSE;
   ```

   The execution time of the `ANALYZE` command can vary significantly depending on your database size. To monitor the progress of this operation,
   you can periodically run the following query in another PostgreSQL database console. The `tables_remaining` column should gradually reach `0`:

   ```SQL
   SELECT
     COUNT(*) AS total_tables,
     SUM(CASE WHEN last_analyze IS NULL OR last_analyze < (NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS tables_remaining
   FROM pg_stat_user_tables;
   ```

   If the upgrade used `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`, run the following query on the PostgreSQL database console:

   ```SQL
   SET statement_timeout = 0; VACUUM VERBOSE ANALYZE;
   ```

### Seed the database (fresh installs only)

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

This is a destructive command; do not run it on an existing database.

{{< /alert >}}

The Linux package installation does not seed your external database. Run the following command
to import the schema and create the first administration user:

```shell
# Remove 'sudo' if you are the 'git' user
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:setup
```

If you want to specify a password for the default `root` user, specify the
`initial_root_password` setting in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` before running the
`gitlab:setup` command above:

```ruby
gitlab_rails['initial_root_password'] = 'nonstandardpassword'
```

If you want to specify the initial registration token for shared GitLab Runners,
specify the `initial_shared_runners_registration_token` setting in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`
before running the `gitlab:setup` command:

```ruby
gitlab_rails['initial_shared_runners_registration_token'] = 'token'
```

### Pin the packaged PostgreSQL version (fresh installs only)

The Linux package ships with [different PostgreSQL versions](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/package_information/postgresql_versions/)
and initializes the default version if not specified otherwise.

To initialize PostgreSQL with a non-default version, you can set `postgresql['version']` to the major version one of
the [packaged PostgreSQL versions](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/package_information/postgresql_versions/) prior to the initial reconfigure.
For example, in GitLab 17.10 you can use `postgresql['version'] = 14` to use PostgreSQL 14 instead of the default of PostgreSQL 16.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Setting `postgresql['version']` while using the PostgreSQL packaged with the Linux package after the initial reconfigure will
throw errors about the data directory being initialized on a different version of PostgreSQL. If this is encountered,
see [Revert packaged PostgreSQL server to the previous version](#revert-packaged-postgresql-server-to-the-previous-version).

{{< /alert >}}

If you are doing a fresh install on an environment that previously had GitLab installed on it and you are using a pinned PostgreSQL version, first make
sure that any folders that relate to PostgreSQL are deleted and that there are no PostgreSQL processes running on the instance.

## Provide sensitive data configuration to GitLab Rails without plain text storage

For more information, see the example in [configuration documentation](configuration.md#provide-the-postgresql-user-password-to-gitlab-rails).

## Application Settings for the Database

### Disabling automatic database migration

If you have multiple GitLab servers sharing a database, you will want to limit the
number of nodes that are performing the migration steps during reconfiguration.

Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` to append:

```ruby
# Enable or disable automatic database migrations
# on all hosts except the designated deploy node
gitlab_rails['auto_migrate'] = false
```

`/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` should have file permissions `0600` because it contains
plain-text passwords.

The next time hosts carrying the above configuration are reconfigured, the migration steps are not performed.

To avoid schema-related post-upgrade errors, the host marked as [the deploy node](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/zero_downtime/) must have
`gitlab_rails['auto_migrate'] = true` during upgrades.

### Setting client `statement_timeout`

The amount of time that Rails will wait for a database transaction to complete
before timing out can now be adjusted with the `gitlab_rails['db_statement_timeout']`
setting. By default, this setting is not used.

Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

```ruby
gitlab_rails['db_statement_timeout'] = 45000
```

In this case, the client `statement_timeout` is set to 45 seconds. The value
is specified in milliseconds.

### Setting connection timeout

The amount of time that Rails will wait for a PostgreSQL connection attempt to succeed
before timing out can be adjusted with the `gitlab_rails['db_connect_timeout']`
setting. By default, this setting is not used:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['db_connect_timeout'] = 5
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

In this case, the client `connect_timeout` is set to 5 seconds. The value
is specified in seconds. A minimum value of 2 seconds applies. Setting this to `<= 0`
or not specifying the setting at all disables the timeout.

### Setting TCP controls

The Rails PostgreSQL adapter provides a series of TCP connection controls
that may be tuned to improve performance. Consult the
[PostgreSQL upstream documentation for more information about each parameter](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-KEEPALIVES).

The Linux package sets no defaults for these values and instead uses the defaults
provided by the PostgreSQL adapter. Override them in `gitlab.rb` using the
parameters noted in the table below and then run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.

| PostgreSQL parameter  | `gitlab.rb` parameter |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| `keepalives`          | `gitlab_rails['db_keepalives']` |
| `keepalives_idle`     | `gitlab_rails['db_keepalives_idle']` |
| `keepalives_interval` | `gitlab_rails['db_keepalives_interval']` |
| `keepalives_count`    | `gitlab_rails['db_keepalives_count']` |
| `tcp_user_timeout`    | `gitlab_rails['db_tcp_user_timeout']` |

## Automatic database reindexing

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

This is an experimental feature that isn't enabled by default.

{{< /alert >}}

Recreates database indexes in the background (called "reindexing"). This can
be used to remove bloated space that has accumulated in indexes and helps to maintain healthy and
efficient indexes.

The reindexing task can be started regularly through a cronjob. To configure the cronjob,
`gitlab_rails['database_reindexing']['enable']` should be set to `true`.

In a multi-node environment, this feature should only be enabled on an application host.
The reindexing process cannot go through PgBouncer, it has to have a direct database connection.

By default, this starts the cronjob every hour during weekends (likely a low-traffic time) only.

You can change the schedule by refining the following settings:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```shell
   gitlab_rails['database_reindexing']['hour'] = '*'
   gitlab_rails['database_reindexing']['minute'] = 0
   gitlab_rails['database_reindexing']['month'] = '*'
   gitlab_rails['database_reindexing']['day_of_month'] = '*'
   gitlab_rails['database_reindexing']['day_of_week'] = '0,6'
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

## Packaged PostgreSQL deployed in an HA/Geo Cluster

### Upgrading a GitLab HA cluster

To upgrade the PostgreSQL version in a Patroni cluster see [Upgrading PostgreSQL major version in a Patroni cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover/#upgrading-postgresql-major-version-in-a-patroni-cluster).

### Troubleshooting upgrades in an HA cluster

If at some point, the bundled PostgreSQL had been running on a node before upgrading to an HA setup, the old data directory may remain. This will cause `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` to downgrade the version of the PostgreSQL utilities it uses on that node. Move (or remove) the directory to prevent this:

- `mv /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data/ /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data.$(date +%s)`

If you encounter the following error when recreating the secondary nodes with `gitlab-ctl repmgr standby setup MASTER_NODE_NAME`, ensure that you have `postgresql['max_replication_slots'] = X` (where `X` is the number of DB nodes + 1), is included in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

```shell
pg_basebackup: could not create temporary replication slot "pg_basebackup_12345": ERROR:  all replication slots are in use
HINT:  Free one or increase max_replication_slots.
```

### Upgrading a Geo instance

Since Geo depends on PostgreSQL streaming replication by default, there are
additional considerations when upgrading GitLab and/or when upgrading
PostgreSQL is described below.

#### Caveats when upgrading PostgreSQL with Geo

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

When using Geo, upgrading PostgreSQL requires downtime on all secondaries
because it requires re-initializing PostgreSQL replication to Geo
**secondaries**. This is due to the way PostgreSQL streaming replication works.
Re-initializing replication copies all data from the primary again, so it can
take a long time depending mostly on the size of the database and available
bandwidth. For example, at a transfer speed of 30 Mbps, and a database size of
100 GB, resynchronization could take approximately 8 hours. See
[PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/pgupgrade.html)
for more.

{{< /alert >}}

#### How to upgrade PostgreSQL when using Geo

To upgrade PostgreSQL, you will need the name of the replication slot, and the
replication user's password.

1. Find the name of the existing replication slot on the Geo primary's database
   node, run:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-psql -qt -c 'select slot_name from pg_replication_slots'
   ```

   If you can't find your `slot_name` here, or there is no output returned, your Geo secondaries may not be healthy. In that case, make sure the [secondaries are healthy and replication is working](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/geo/replication/troubleshooting/common/#health-check-rake-task).

   Even if the query is empty, you can try to reinitialize the secondary database with the `slot_name` found on the [Geo sites admin area](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/geo_sites/).

1. Gather the replication user's password. It was set while setting up Geo in
   [Step 1. Configure the primary site](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/geo/setup/database/#step-1-configure-the-primary-site).

1. Optional. [Pause replication on each **secondary** site](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/geo/#pausing-and-resuming-replication)
   to protect their disaster recovery (DR) capability.

1. Manually upgrade PostgreSQL on the Geo primary. Run on the Geo primary's
   database node:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl pg-upgrade
   ```

   Wait for the **primary database** to finish upgrading before
   beginning the following step, so the secondary can remain ready as a backup.
   Afterward, you can upgrade the **tracking database** in parallel with the
   **secondary database**.

1. Manually upgrade PostgreSQL on the Geo secondaries. Run on the Geo
   **secondary database** and also on the **tracking database**:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl pg-upgrade
   ```

1. Restart the database replication on the Geo **secondary database** using the
   command:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl replicate-geo-database --slot-name=SECONDARY_SLOT_NAME --host=PRIMARY_HOST_NAME --sslmode=verify-ca
   ```

   You will be prompted for the replication user's password of the primary. Replace `SECONDARY_SLOT_NAME` with the slot name retrieved from the first step above.

1. [Reconfigure GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/restart_gitlab/#reconfigure-a-linux-package-installation) on the Geo **secondary database** to update the
   `pg_hba.conf` file. This is needed because `replicate-geo-database`
   replicates the primary's file to the secondary.

1. If you paused replication in step 3,
   [resume replication on each **secondary**](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/geo/#pausing-and-resuming-replication).

1. Restart `puma`, `sidekiq`, and `geo-logcursor`.

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl hup puma
   sudo gitlab-ctl restart sidekiq
   sudo gitlab-ctl restart geo-logcursor
   ```

1. Navigate to `https://your_primary_server/admin/geo/sites` and ensure that all Geo sites are healthy.

## Connecting to the PostgreSQL database

If you need to connect to the PostgreSQL database, you can connect as the
application user:

```shell
sudo gitlab-rails dbconsole --database main
```

## Troubleshooting

### Set `default_transaction_isolation` into `read committed`

If you see errors similar to the following in your `production/sidekiq` log:

```plaintext
ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid PG::TRSerializationFailure: ERROR:  could not serialize access due to concurrent update
```

Chances are your database's `default_transaction_isolation` configuration is not
in line with the GitLab application requirement. You can check this configuration by
connecting to your PostgreSQL database and run `SHOW default_transaction_isolation;`.
GitLab application expects `read committed` to be configured.

This `default_transaction_isolation` configuration is set in your
`postgresql.conf` file. You will need to restart/reload the database after you
changed the configuration. This configuration comes by default in the packaged
PostgreSQL server included with the Linux package.

### Could not load library `plpgsql.so`

You might see errors similar to the following while running Database migrations
or in the PostgreSQL/Patroni logs:

```plaintext
ERROR:  could not load library "/opt/gitlab/embedded/postgresql/12/lib/plpgsql.so": /opt/gitlab/embedded/postgresql/12/lib/plpgsql.so: undefined symbol: EnsurePortalSnapshotExists
```

This error is caused due to not restarting PostgreSQL after the underlying
version changed. To fix this error:

1. Run one of the following commands:

   ```shell
   # For PostgreSQL
   sudo gitlab-ctl restart postgresql

   # For Patroni
   sudo gitlab-ctl restart patroni

   # For Geo PostgreSQL
   sudo gitlab-ctl restart geo-postgresql
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

### Database CPU load very high

If the database CPU load is very high, it could be caused by the [auto cancel redundant pipelines setting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/settings/#auto-cancel-redundant-pipelines). For more details, see [issue 435250](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/435250).

To work around this issue:

- You can allocate more CPU resources to the database server.
- If Sidekiq is overloaded, you might need to [add more Sidekiq processes](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/sidekiq/extra_sidekiq_processes/#start-multiple-processes) for the `ci_cancel_redundant_pipelines` queue if your projects have a very large number of pipelines.
- You can enable the `disable_cancel_redundant_pipelines_service` feature flag to disable this setting instance-wide and see if the CPU load goes down. This disables the feature for all projects, and can lead to increased resource use by pipelines that are no longer being cancelled automatically.

### Error: `TypeError: can't quote Array`

If you are using Amazon RDS, during the `gitlab::database_migrations` task, you might see the error: `TypeError: can't quote Array`.

To work around this [known issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/356307), disable the
[`quote_all_identifiers`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.Parameters.html) parameter in the RDS
for a PostgreSQL database.
