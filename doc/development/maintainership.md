## Scoped Maintainership

`omnibus-gitlab` is a comparatively complex project that handles both software
builds and deployment.

The build aspect covers the build toolchain, CI infrastructure, and dependency
management. The deployment aspect covers the installation and configuration of
GitLab at the user site along with upgrade tasks.

Because the two aspects are very different both in nature and the technical
stack involved, trainee-maintainers must spend a large amount of time to gain
both sets of competencies. Scoped maintainership decreases the time required
to onboard a new maintainer through separation of these core responsibilities.

### Build scope

The build scope covers all the parts of the codebase that build the artifacts
used to ship the Linux package.

This includes:

1. `omnibus-gitlab` project configurations and component software definitions.
1. Patches used in software definitions.
1. Libraries and Rake tasks used for build, release, and other maintenance
   activities.
1. CI configuration used for build, release, and other maintenance activities.
1. Infrastructure management required for the above.

Ideally, a build-scoped maintainer of `omnibus-gitlab` should be
well versed in all the above-mentioned topics. Several of these areas
get infrequent updates, therefore it is not fair to expect trainee-maintainers
to work on all of them. The following checklist provides a guideline to evaluate
the progress of a trainee-maintainer in the build scope.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

We do not differentiate between the trainee-maintainer as the author
or reviewer in this list because `omnibus-gitlab` is a relatively stable
and mature project. The majority of merge requests follow established
patterns and only need to pass a set of well known tests that prove
the changes work as expected.

{{< /alert >}}

1. Author or review merge requests which update any 3 components from the list below that
   support high availability. The trainee-maintainer should gain familiarity with complex
   deployment scenarios and how to test them.

     1. PostgreSQL
     1. Patroni
     1. PgBouncer
     1. Consul
     1. Redis
     1. Sentinel

1. Author or review a merge request which updates any of our "runtime" environments, preferably
   Ruby/Go. This ensures familiarity with the
   [Omnibus Builder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-omnibus-builder)
   project and how it relates to `omnibus-gitlab`.

     1. Ruby
     1. Go
     1. Python

1. Author or review a Mattermost version update merge request. Ensures familiarity with its update
   process and Distribution team's communication process with the Mattermost team.

1. Author or review merge requests which update 5 other components.

1. Author or review 3 merge requests which modify CI configuration.

1. Author or review 3 merge requests which refactor build related code.

1. **OPTIONAL**: Author or review 1 merge request which modifies the `omnibus` project. This
   is an optional requirement, because updates to `omnibus` itself are
   comparatively rare. It is highly recommended that the Maintainers look through
   the commits we have [added on top of the upstream tag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus/-/compare/9.0.19...9.0.19-stable).

### Operate scope

The operate scope covers all the parts of the codebase that handle the installation,
configuration, and operation of GitLab at the user site.

This includes:

1. Chef cookbooks and recipes in the `files/` directory.
1. Configuration file templates and `gitlab-ctl` command definitions.
1. Test specifications in the `spec/` directory.
1. Documentation in the `doc/` directory (shared with Build scope).
1. Helper libraries and custom Chef resources for deployment and operations.

Ideally, an operate-scoped maintainer of `omnibus-gitlab` should have
strong Ruby and Chef expertise, with familiarity in Omnibus DSL being
beneficial. They should understand GitLab architectural design and
deployment patterns, particularly for high availability and multi-node
configurations as outlined in the [reference architectures](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/reference_architectures/).

The following checklist provides a guideline to evaluate the progress of a
maintainer in the operate scope:

**Prerequisites:**

1. Demonstrate a good understanding of GitLab instance architectural design
   and the Omnibus project, particularly HA and multi-node support.

1. Show familiarity with Reference Architecture and downstream projects that
   use Omnibus, such as GitLab Environment Toolkit (GET) and cloud-native
   hybrid (CNH) deployments in GitLab Dedicated platform.

**Required Experience:**

Contribution in at least 3 of the following categories:

1. **Configuration Management**: Adding, removing, and deprecating configuration
   options in `gitlab.rb`. This includes understanding how configuration changes
   propagate through the system and affect service behavior.

1. **Command Line Tools**: Adding a new `gitlab-ctl` command or fixing an
   existing one. This demonstrates understanding of the operational interface
   that administrators use to manage GitLab.

1. **Service Management**: Adding a new service or updating an existing service.
   This includes understanding service dependencies, startup sequences, and
   `runit` mechanics.

1. **Testing**: Writing test cases and test scenarios, especially with ChefSpec
   and RSpec. This ensures familiarity with the testing patterns used to
   validate operational changes.

1. **Chef Development**: Working with Chef helper libraries and custom resources.
   This demonstrates deep understanding of the Chef framework used for
   configuration management.

**Highly Recommended Experience:**

1. **HA Components**: Implementing a feature or fixing one for Omnibus HA
   components (PostgreSQL, Patroni, PgBouncer, Consul, Redis, Sentinel).

1. **Database Operations**: Understanding PostgreSQL upgrade nuances and
   database migration processes.

1. **CI Integration**: Exposure to CI pipeline configuration and how it
   relates to operational testing and validation.

### Architectural changes

Architectural changes to `omnibus-gitlab` project, as well as the `omnibus`
project require sign-off from current full maintainers of the project.
