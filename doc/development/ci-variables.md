title: CI Variables
---

`omnibus-gitlab` [CI pipelines](pipelines.md) use variables provided by the CI environment to change build behavior between mirrors and
keep sensitive data out of the repositories.

Check the table below for more information about the various CI variables used in the pipelines.

## Build variables

## DockerHub variables

By default, CI uses images from DockerHub. The default/shared runners
and the distribution runners use a DockerHub mirror to avoid hitting
rate limits.

If you use custom runnners, that don't use caching or mirroring, you
should enable the dependency proxy by setting the `DOCKERHUB_PREFIX`
to your proxy, for example
`DOCKERHUB_PREFIX: ${CI_DEPENDENCY_PROXY_GROUP_IMAGE_PREFIX}`, and
`DEPENDENCY_PROXY_LOGIN="true"`.

The container build context by default uses the gcr DockerHub mirror. This
behavior can be changed by overriding the `DOCKER_OPTIONS` or `DOCKER_MIRROR`
variables.
