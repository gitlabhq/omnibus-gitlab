# Omnibus GitLab Development Setup

## Deprecation

Currently GitLab does not target or provide support for OpenShift Installations. We have extensive and verbose documentation around Kubernetes and Omnibus. However, due to OpenShift's increased security restrictions we do not currently target or support it.

Work is being done to rectify this, This work can be tracked [in this epic.](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2068)

As soon as we finish the engineering work to provide support for OpenShift we'll revise this document with new installation procedures.
