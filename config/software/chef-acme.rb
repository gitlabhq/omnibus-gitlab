# Skip the gitlab-cookbook dependency if already loaded by the project. This improves build-ordering,
# due to how omnibus orders the components. Components that are dependencies of other components
# get moved in front of ones that are only defined in the project. Without this gate, gitlab-cookbooks
# ends up in front of components that change less frequently.
# Omnibus Build order: https://github.com/chef/omnibus/blob/c872e61c30d2b3f88ead03bd1254ff96d37059a3/lib/omnibus/library.rb#L64
